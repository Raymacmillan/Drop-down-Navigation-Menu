## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned about the fundamentals of JQuery and some of its properties such as animation properties.I also learned how to create a Navigation Menu as it was my first time to learn to do such an incredible thing.I also learned how to use Javascript to manipulate different images that appear on the screen



### Continued development

I still need to work more on Navigation systems as i faced many challenges that i could not solve and i am still not comfortable in creating the navigation menu for both devices(Desktop and Mobile devices).
